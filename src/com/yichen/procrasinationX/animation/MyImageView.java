/**
 * MyImageView is derived from ImageView and adds getters and setters for
 * properties xFraction and yFraction. These properties allow to position a
 * MyImageView instance within its parent based on a percentage (and not an
 * absolute pixel position). The setter setX() and setY() allow to position the
 * image within its parent based on absolute pixel coordinates. The reason the
 * xFraction and yFraction are introduced is to be independent of the actual
 * size of the parent. I.e., the animation specification in bounce.xml can only
 * contain hard-coded values for the 'valueTo' parameter. Since the actual width
 * of the parent is not known at compile time, 'valueTo' is interpreted as a
 * percentage (where 0 represents the left/top of the parent and 1 represents
 * the right/bottom of the parent). The setters for xFraction and yFraction
 * compute the actual pixel positions based on the current width and height of
 * the parent.

     * image is initially positioned in the top-left corner of the parent (see
     * activity_main.xml), so the kludge it OK. Computing the correct value is
     * surprisingly difficult. The reason is that getXFraction() will be called
     * when the layout computation has not finished yet. I.e., calling
     * getParent().getWidth() will return 0 since the parent's geometry has not
     * yet been determined. A proper solution would require the use of a
     * LayoutListener which would make this example unnecessarily complex. Note
     * that by the time setXFraction() is called the parent has a proper width.
